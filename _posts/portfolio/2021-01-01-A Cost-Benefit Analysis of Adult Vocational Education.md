## A Cost-Benefit Analysis of Adult Vocational Education Spending in Sweden in 2020
<em>
This paper performs a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed 250 000 000 SEK budget addition to the vocational education sector in Sweden. Relying on existing literature of how Swedish vocational education affects wages and employment levels as well as how unemployment affects general health, this paper finds that the benefits of the policy exceeds its costs in the ten year time horizon from its implementation. Therefore, in accordance with the Kaldor-Hicks criterion, this paper recommends continued expansion of the adult vocational education sector in Sweden, as per the proposed budget addition. 
The main benefits arise from an increase in wages as a result of the vocational education and not from the increase in quality of life, assoicated with finding work. Sensitivity analysis shows that a more pessimistic (higher) assumption about the Social Discount Rate makes the policy produce a negative societal net benefit
Whilst this paper feels comfortable with this recommendation, some caveats should be added. The policy is potentially non-efficient as long as the labour market does not demand that the person who gets the education needs to get educated again within a ten year-period. Additionally, in case of significant structural changes to the labour market, the analysis herein might have to be redone.
