# Predictions for a Portugese Banking Institution
<em>
This presentation provides recommendations for a portugese banking institution about how to gain more customers. Through regression trees we find that the bank should contact those who haven't been contacted before, during some months and those above the age of 60. Additionally, using Random Forest we find that the duration between the first and second call and age of the customer are important variables toexploit when optimising acquisition of new customers.
